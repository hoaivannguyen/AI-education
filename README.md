# Personalizing Education

With the combination of gamification

## Summary

Using AI combine with gamification to personalize educational programmes.

## Background

There are personalization in music, movies, news and so on but never have anyone thought about doing it in education which is an important sector. With the combination of gamification - a method of applying game's elements into non-game or boring contexts, this project will surely turn a day in school of a student into a game which is fun, engaging and high learning 


* Students are being crammed with the same knowledge and not being focus on their strength and passion -> a factory with the repititive process produce alike products rather than a school nurture a variety of outstanding individuals
* School focus too much on tests, results rather than human's experience and process -> frightening and boring curriculum


## How is it used?


Firstly, AI will creat a recommendation systet to fit with subjects they love and teachers that suitable for them. For teachers, they will also have a recommendation for their students with the same passion and interests. It works like Tinder :) but instead getting a match in education

Gamification will create an exciting environement for both teachers and students. With the help of AI, personalized learning paths will be created consisting of challenges, levels that suitable with students' compaibilities.


## Data sources and AI methods
TF-IDF, Similarity Measurements, Users' Data and Statistics


## Challenges

It it probably the consensus between school's sectors, between students and teachers to collaborate each other or it can be hard to implement. Also this method rely alot in technology so budget is another thing to consider,

## What next?

I hope one day the whole education system can apply this method, making children want to learn more!
